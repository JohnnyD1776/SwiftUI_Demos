# SwiftUI Demo Project

Welcome to the SwiftUI Demo Project! This repository showcases a collection of advanced SwiftUI animation, layout, and interaction techniques. Built by John Durcan at Itch Studio Ltd., it demonstrates creative ways to build intuitive and engaging iOS and macOS apps using SwiftUI.

The project includes various demos, from matched geometry effects and parallax scrolling to a fully functional Flappy Bird clone and sensor island-aware padding. It's designed as a learning resource and inspiration for developers exploring SwiftUI's capabilities.

Each demo is self-contained, with animations, gestures, and layout techniques optimized for both iOS and macOS where applicable.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JohnnyD1776/SwiftUI-Demo-Project.git
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   - Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode (requires Xcode 15+ for full SwiftUI features).
   - Build and run on an iOS simulator, device, or macOS (Catalyst).

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Ad SymbolPicker available at https://github.com/xnth97/SymbolPicker
   - Tested on iOS 17+ and macOS 14+.

Note: Some demos (e.g., Flappy Bird) are optimized for landscape mode on iPhone. The sensor island demo requires an iPhone with Dynamic Island (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro or later) for full effect‚Äîtest on a physical device or simulator.

## Usage

- Launch the app and select a demo from the sidebar.
- Interact with each demo:
  - Tap cards in Geometry Demo to expand/collapse.
  - Drag to scroll in Parallax Demo.
  - Tap to jump in Flappy Bird (landscape only).
  - Rotate the device in Sensor Island Demo to see dynamic padding updates.
